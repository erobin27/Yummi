TODO:
create .csv data parser (look into importing d3.js it is similar to pandas https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30610675/python-pandas-equivalent-in-javascript )
setup Redux
-this should help us set an active spreadsheet per user
-this will also be required to send selected item from itemlist to graph component
-determine if user is logged in

create backend/database
create manage page
create account page
Finish top of dashboard page
check that file extension is .csv or .xlx display error if not
design different types of graph components (barchart, line, pie, etc...)

TODO: (On Hold)
format graph component to take data as props and change dynamically (shouldn't be too hard) [Redux] [Parser]
change navbar if user is not logged in [Redux]
route user to login page if they try to navigate to /dashboard, /manage, /account, etc.. [Redux] [Database]
when file is uploaded save it in database under userID [Database]
setup OAuth login [Database] - setup OAuth login on Redux

TODO: (In the future)
Add ability to compare two items (Double BarChart, Double LineChart, etc..) [This should be sort of easy once we have the graph working]
Add predicition/machine learning [I have faith that we can make it to this]





COMPLETED:
Get sample spreadsheet
